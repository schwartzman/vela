Money's a wonderful thing, and if you just want to donate now, the [form below](#form) will let you do so with your credit card. (We also accept bank wires, TransferWise, and PayPal - please [contact us](/contact/) for details on those kinds of transactions.)

If you have a moment, though, read on.

What we really want, much more than your money, is a piece of your everlasting soul. No, really. Sit and drink tea with us. Tell us about your dreams and your fears. We'll tell you about ours. Let's think about how we can help _each other._ Maybe you'll help us with an offer of your time, or with an introduction to a friend or colleague, or with the donation a boat (we need boats!). Maybe we'll help you realize a long-held ambition, or provide a vehicle for an expression of your deepest gifts. Maybe you'll ask a difficult question that transforms us in some way and helps us become the organization we're meant to be. Maybe you'll offer words of wisdom or encouragement at a pivotal moment. And yes, maybe you'll donate some money. But please don't rush. The relationship with you at a human level is infinitely more valuable than a few hundred or a few thousand bucks. We want to hear your story. [Let's talk.](/contact/)
